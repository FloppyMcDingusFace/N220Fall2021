    Homework 4
    <a href="homework4/part1/index.html">Part 1-Neapolitan</a> <br />

    <a href="homework4/part3/index.html">Part 3-Original Composition</a><br />

    <p>Homework 3</p>
    <a href="homework3/part1/index.html">Part 1-FizzBuzz</a> <br />
    <a href="homework3/part2/index.html">Part 2-Circles inside of Circles</a> <br />
    <a href="homework3/part3/index.html">Part 3-Pyramid</a> <br />

    <p>Homework 3 reflection:<br />This assignment was much harder for me. I could not get FizzBuzz to work using loops, so I had to do it all by hand, (though luckily the prompt
        did not require it) but luckily for me Circles inside of Circles and Pyramid were much easier to get the loops to work because I could layer
        basic loops or prompt ideas. I tried originally to do arrays on the first prompt but it did not work. The intial code is still in the JS folder for part 1.

    <a href="homework2/part3/index.html">Part 3-Ever Larger, until not</a>
	
	<p> Home Work 2 Reflection:</p><br>
<p>Generally this assignment was rougher on me than normal because of my ear infection causing me to miss class, and so I had to mostly rely on the p5.js book and the videos. My initial difficulties mostly came as the p5 code did not work as well as I wanted it to, but it began to make more sense once I had watched the course videos and changed my code accordingly to make more logical statements and set a more organized methodology.</p>
