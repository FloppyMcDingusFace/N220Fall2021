	<p>Reflection:</p><br>
<p>Generally this assignment was rougher on me than normal because of my ear infection causing me to miss class, and so I had to mostly rely on the p5.js book and the videos. My initial difficulties mostly came as the p5 code did not work as well as I wanted it to, but it began to make more sense once I had watched the course videos and changed my code accordingly to make more logical statements and set a more organized methodology.</p>
